Let $P$ be a hyperplane  in $\pCP^n$ which contains the singular points (if any) of $V$.  Then the inclusion map  \begin{align*}    V\cap P &\into V \\    \intertext{induces isomorphims of homology groups in dimensions      less than $k-1$.  Furthermore, the induced homomorphism}    \Homol_{k-1}(V\cap P;\rZ) &\onto\Homol_{k-1}(V;\rZ)  \end{align*}  is onto.\end{theorem}\begin{proof}  The long exact sequence of the pair $(V,V\cap P)$  \begin{align*}    \cdots\to\Homol_{r+1}(V,V\cap P)\to\Homol_r V\cap P\to\Homol_r    V\to\Homol_r(V,V\cap P)\to\cdots  \end{align*}  along with a proof that $\Homol_r(V,V\cap P)=0$ for $r\le k-1$ is  enough.  By Lefschetz duality  \begin{align}\label{eqn:homol1}    \Homol_r(V,V\cap P)&\cong\Homol^{2k-r}(V-(V\cap P)).  \end{align}  And since $\mM=V-(V\cap P)\to\pCP^n-P\cong\rC^n$ is a non-singular  affine algebraic variety of complex dimension $k$, it has the  homotopy type of a $k$-dimensional CW-complex.  So the RHS of  equation~\ref{eqn:homol1} is 0.\end{proof}% REQUIRED: The start of arabic-numbered plain pages.% GSAS formatting allowance: The back may be single-spaced.\backmatter\singlespacing% The \phantomsection command must be placed before any section whose% hyperlinks don't refer to the right place.\phantomsection\bibliographystyle{amsplain}% Bibliography.\bibliography{topology}\end{document}
