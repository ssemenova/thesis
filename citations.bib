  abstract = {In distributed database systems, tables are frequently fragmented and replicated over a number of sites in order to reduce network communication costs. How to fragment, when to replicate and how to allocate the fragments to the sites are challenging problems that has previously been solved either by static fragmentation, replication and allocation, or based on a priori query analysis. Many emerging applications of distributed database systems generate very dynamic workloads with frequent changes in access patterns from different sites. In such contexts, continuous refragmentation and reallocation can significantly improve performance. In this paper we present DYFRAM, a decentralized approach for dynamic table fragmentation and allocation in distributed database systems based on observation of the access patterns of sites to tables. The approach performs fragmentation, replication, and reallocation based on recent access history, aiming at maximizing the number of local accesses compared to accesses from remote sites. We show through simulations and experiments on the DASCOSA distributed database system that the approach significantly reduces communication costs for typical access patterns, thus demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.},

  abstract = {The Mariposa distributed data manager uses an economic model for managing the allocation of both storage objects and queries to servers. We present extensions to the economic model which support replica management, as well as our mechanisms for propagating updates among replicas. We show how our replica control mechanism can be used to provide consistent, although potentially stale, views of data across many machines without expensive per-transaction synchronization. We present a rule-based conflict resolution mechanism, which can be used to enhance traditional time-stamp serialization. We discuss the effects of our replica system on query processing for both read-only and read-write queries. We further demonstrate how the replication model and mechanisms naturally support name service in Mariposa},

  doi = {10.14778/1920841.1920853},
  abstract = {We present Schism, a novel workload-aware approach for database partitioning and replication designed to improve scalability of shared-nothing distributed databases. Because distributed transactions are expensive in OLTP settings (a fact we demonstrate through a series of experiments), our partitioner attempts to minimize the number of distributed transactions, while producing balanced partitions. Schism consists of two phases: i) a workload-driven, graph-based replication/partitioning phase and ii) an explanation and validation phase. The first phase creates a graph with a node per tuple (or group of tuples) and edges between nodes accessed by the same transaction, and then uses a graph partitioner to split the graph into k balanced partitions that minimize the number of cross-partition transactions. The second phase exploits machine learning techniques to find a predicate-based explanation of the partitioning strategy (i.e., a set of range predicates that represent the same replication/partitioning scheme produced by the partitioner). The strengths of Schism are: i) independence from the schema layout, ii) effectiveness on n-to-n relations, typical in social network databases, iii) a unified and fine-grained approach to replication and partitioning. We implemented and tested a prototype of Schism on a wide spectrum of test cases, ranging from classical OLTP workloads (e.g., TPC-C and TPC-E), to more complex scenarios derived from social network websites (e.g., Epinions.com), whose schema contains multiple n-to-n relationships, which are known to be hard to partition. Schism consistently outperforms simple partitioning schemes, and in some cases proves superior to the best known manual partitioning, reducing the cost of distributed transactions up to 30\%.},
